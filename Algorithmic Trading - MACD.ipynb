It represents the difference between the value of a slower Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from a faster EMA. In other words, an EMA with a longer time period is substracted from an EMA with a shorter time period. The signal trend in found by computing the EMA with an even shorter time span."

The function *.ewm* allows the calculation of the exponential moving average. The component *span* replaces $\\frac{2}{1 + n}$ in the equation above.

Therefore, the price at which the share is bought, i.e. the next day is retrieved using the function *.iloc*.\n",
